            "long1": "Initially developing the mod as a useful addon for a private server among friends, I realised that if we needed it, it was likely that others would too. And so, with a little bit of polish, I published the mod on steam, and within a month I had over 2000 unique users. Almost a year later and the mod has grown to have over 12,000 unique users and in this time, I have maintained active development, responding to user feedback on the steam community page and implementing requested features, in addition to quickly patching any bugs reported by users.",
            "long2": "The mods are built using Studio Wildcard's modified Unreal Engine 5 build, and are built to be as configurable as possible. An additional website was developed using next.js (which is hosted on this site at jopat2409.dev/atm) which was designed to help users of the mod find the imported content on the map in an interactive and user-friendly way.",
